Test-only Triton kernel launchers.

These launchers directly invoke Triton kernels (bypassing @triton_op wrappers)
and use num_edges as GRID_E_STRIDE for simpler testing. Production code uses
the autograd Functions in the triton/ package which use fixed GRID_E_STRIDE=2048
for torch.compile compatibility.

These should NOT be used in production - only for unit testing kernel correctness.
