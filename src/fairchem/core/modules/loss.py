class DDPMTLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    This class is a wrapper around a loss function that does a few things
    like handle nans and importantly ensures the reduction is done
    correctly for DDP. The main issue is that DDP averages gradients
    over replicas — this only works out of the box if the dimension
    you are averaging over is completely consistent across all replicas.
    In our case, that is not true for the number of atoms per batch and
    there are edge cases when the batch size differs between replicas
    e.g. if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch_size.

    Scalars are relatively straightforward to handle, but vectors and higher tensors
    are a bit trickier. Below are two examples of forces.

    Forces input: [Nx3] target: [Nx3]
    Forces are a vector of length 3 (x,y,z) for each atom.
    Number of atoms per batch (N) is different for each DDP replica.

    MSE example:
    #### Local loss computation ####
    local_loss = MSELoss(input, target) -> [Nx3]
    num_samples = local_loss.numel() -> [Nx3]
    local_loss = sum(local_loss [Nx3]) -> [1] sum reduces the loss to a scalar
    global_samples = all_reduce(num_samples) -> [N0x3 + N1x3 + N2x3 + ...] = [1] where N0 is the number of atoms on replica 0
    local_loss = local_loss * world_size / global_samples -> [1]
    #### Global loss computation ####
    global_loss = sum(local_loss / world_size) -> [1]
    == sum(local_loss / global_samples) # this is the desired corrected mean

    Norm example:
    #### Local loss computation ####
    local_loss = L2MAELoss(input, target) -> [N]
    num_samples = local_loss.numel() -> [N]
    local_loss = sum(local_loss [N]) -> [1] sum reduces the loss to a scalar
