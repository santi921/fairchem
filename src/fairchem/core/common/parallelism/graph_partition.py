    Spatial partitioning via Morton Z-order curve on GPU.

    Computes a 30-bit Morton code per atom by interleaving 10 bits
    from each spatial axis. Sorting by Morton code groups spatially
    nearby atoms together, minimizing boundary edges. Atoms are
    then split into num_ranks equal chunks in sorted order.

    Runs entirely on GPU with zero CPU transfers or sync points
    (unlike recursive coordinate bisection which requires CPU
    round-trips). The Morton curve provides O(N^{2/3}) surface
    fraction per partition, similar to recursive bisection.
