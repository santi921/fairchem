# Fine-tuning

This repo provides a number of scripts to quickly fine-tune a model using a custom ASE LMDB dataset. These scripts are merely for convenience and fine-tuning uses the exact same tooling and infrastructure as our standard training (see Training section). Training in the fairchem repo uses the fairchem CLI tool and configs are in [Hydra yaml](https://hydra.cc/) format.

:::{danger} Security Warning
**Never run YAML configuration files from untrusted sources.** FAIRChem uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) to instantiate Python objects from YAML configs via the `_target_` key. A maliciously crafted config file can execute arbitrary code on your machine. Only use configs that you have written yourself or that come from trusted sources. This is analogous to the security risks of Python's `pickle` and `torch.load()`.
:::

:::{note}
Training datasets must be in the [ASE-lmdb format](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html#ase.db.core.connect). For UMA models, we provide a simple script to help generate ASE-lmdb datasets from a variety of input formats (CIFs, traj, extxyz, etc.) as well as a fine-tuning YAML config that can be directly used for fine-tuning.
:::

## Generating Training/Fine-tuning Datasets

First we need to generate a dataset in the aselmdb format for fine-tuning.

:::{tip}
The only requirement is that you have input files that can be read as ASE atoms objects by the `ase.io.read` routine and that they contain energy (forces, stress) in the correct format. For concrete examples, refer to the test at `tests/core/scripts/test_create_finetune_dataset.py`.
:::

First you should checkout the fairchem repo and install it to access the scripts

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [skip-execution]
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/fairchem.git

pip install -e fairchem/src/packages/fairchem-core[dev]
```

Run this script to create the aselmdbs as well as a set of templated yamls for finetuning, we will use a few dummy structures for demonstration purposes
```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
os.chdir('../../../../fairchem')
! python src/fairchem/core/scripts/create_uma_finetune_dataset.py --train-dir docs/core/common_tasks/finetune_assets/train/ --val-dir docs/core/common_tasks/finetune_assets/val --output-dir /tmp/bulk --uma-task=omat --regression-task e
```

:::{warning}
**Task Selection:** The `uma-task` can be one of: `omol`, `odac`, `oc20`, `oc22`, `oc25`, `omat`, `omc`. While UMA was trained in a multi-task fashion, we ONLY support fine-tuning on a single UMA task at a time. Multi-task training can become very complicated! Feel free to contact us on GitHub if you have a special use-case for multi-task fine-tuning, or refer to the training configs in `/training_release` to mimic the original UMA training configs.
:::

:::{admonition} Regression Task Options
:class: dropdown

The `regression-task` can be one of:
- **e**: Energy only
- **ef**: Energy + forces
- **efs**: Energy + forces + stress

Choose based on the data you have available in the ASE db. For example, some aperiodic DFT codes only support energy/forces and not gradients, and some very fancy codes like QMC only produce energies.

**Note:** Even if you train on just energy or energy/forces, all gradients (forces/stresses) will be computable via the model gradients.
:::

This will generate a folder of LMDBs and a `uma_sm_finetune_template.yaml` that you can run directly with the fairchem CLI to start training.

:::{tip}
If you want to only create the ASE LMDBs, you can use `src/fairchem/core/scripts/create_finetune_dataset.py` which is called by `create_uma_finetune_dataset.py`.
:::

## Model Fine-tuning (Default Settings)

The previous step should have generated some YAML files to get you started on fine-tuning. You can simply run this with the `fairchem` CLI. The default is configured to run locally on 1 GPU.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [skip-execution]
! fairchem -c /tmp/bulk/uma_sm_finetune_template.yaml
```

## Advanced Configuration

The scripts provide a simple way to get started on fine-tuning, but likely for your own use cases you will need to modify the parameters. The configuration uses [Hydra-style YAMLs](https://hydra.cc/).

:::{tip}
To modify the generated YAMLs, you can either edit the files directly or use [Hydra override notation](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/). Changing parameters on the command line is very simple:
:::

```{code-cell} ipython3
! fairchem -c /tmp/bulk/uma_sm_finetune_template.yaml epochs=2 lr=2e-4 job.run_dir=/tmp/finetune_dir +job.timestamp_id=some_id
```

The basic YAML configuration looks like the following:

```yaml
job:
  device_type: CUDA
  scheduler:
    mode: LOCAL
    ranks_per_node: 1
    num_nodes: 1
  debug: True
  run_dir: /tmp/uma_finetune_runs/
  run_name: uma_finetune
  logger:
    _target_: fairchem.core.common.logger.WandBSingletonLogger.init_wandb
    _partial_: true
    entity: example
    project: uma_finetune


base_model_name: uma-s-1p2
max_neighbors: 300
epochs: 1
steps: null
batch_size: 2
lr: 4e-4

train_dataloader ...
eval_dataloader ...
runner ...
```

:::{admonition} Configuration Parameters
:class: dropdown

- **base_model_name**: Refers to a model name that can be retrieved from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/facebook/UMA). If you want to use your custom UMA checkpoint, provide the path directly in the runner:

  ```yaml
  model:
    _target_: fairchem.core.units.mlip_unit.mlip_unit.initialize_finetuning_model
    checkpoint_location: /path/to/your/checkpoint.pt
  ```

- **max_neighbors**: The number of neighbors used for the equivariant SO2 convolutions. 300 is the default used in UMA training, but if you don't have a lot of memory, 100 is usually fine to ensure smoothness of the potential (see the [ESEN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12147)).

- **epochs**, **steps**: Choose to either run for an integer number of epochs or steps. Only 1 can be specified; the other must be null.

- **batch_size**: In this configuration we use the batch sampler. Start with the largest batch size that can fit on your system without running out of memory. However, don't use a batch size so large that you complete training in very few steps. The optimal batch size is usually the one that minimizes the final validation loss for a fixed compute budget.

- **lr**, **weight_decay**: These are standard learning parameters. The recommended values we use are the defaults.
:::

### Logging and Artifacts

For logging and checkpoints, all artifacts are stored in the location specified in `job.run_dir`. The visual logger we support is [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/).

:::{warning}
Tensorboard is no longer supported. You must set up your W&B account separately and `job.debug` must be set to `False` for W&B logging to work.
:::

### Distributed Training

We support multi-GPU distributed training without additional infrastructure and multi-node distributed training on [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) only.

**Multi-GPU locally:** Simply set `job.scheduler.ranks_per_node=N` where N is the number of GPUs you want to train on.

**Multi-node on SLURM:** Change `job.scheduler.mode=SLURM` and set both `job.scheduler.ranks_per_node` and `job.scheduler.num_nodes` to the desired values.

:::{note}
The `run_dir` must be in a shared network accessible mount for multi-node training to work.
:::

### Resuming Runs

To resume from a checkpoint in the middle of a run, find the checkpoint folder at the step you want and use the same fairchem command:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [skip-execution]
! fairchem -c /tmp/finetune_dir/some_id/checkpoints/final/resume.yaml
```

### Running Inference on the Fine-tuned Model

Inference is run in the same way as the UMA models, except you need to load the checkpoint from a local path.

:::{warning}
You must use the same task that you used for fine-tuning!
:::

```{code-cell} ipython3
from fairchem.core.units.mlip_unit import load_predict_unit
from fairchem.core import FAIRChemCalculator

predictor = load_predict_unit("/tmp/finetune_dir/some_id/checkpoints/final/inference_ckpt.pt")
calc = FAIRChemCalculator(predictor, task_name="omat")
```
