# `fairchem` by FAIR Chemistry

`fairchem` is the [FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/) Chemistry's centralized repository of all its data, models,
demos, and application efforts for materials science and quantum chemistry.

> :warning: **FAIRChem version 2 is a breaking change from version 1 and is not compatible with our previous pretrained models and code.**
> If you want to use an older model or code from version 1 you will need to install [version 1](https://pypi.org/project/fairchem-core/1.10.0/),
> as detailed [here](#looking-for-fairchem-v1-models-and-code).

> :warning: Some of the docs and new features in FAIRChem version 2 are still being updated so you may see some changes over the next few weeks. Check back here for the latest instructions. Thank you for your patience!

## Installation
Although not required, we highly recommend installing using a package manager and virtualenv such as [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer), it is much faster and better at resolving dependencies than standalone pip.

Install fairchem-core using pip
```bash
pip install fairchem-core
```
